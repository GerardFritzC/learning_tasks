		<p><b>Ingredients</b> <br>
Rice (as much as you fancy really!) <br>
Half an onion (Or more, again if you fancy it) <br>
A tin of sweetcorn <br>
A few mushrooms <br>
1-­‐2 eggs <br>
</p>

		<p><b>Method</b> <br> 
Start cooking the rice however you do, and put some oil in a frying pan. <br>
Chop the onion into bits, any size really, doesnt matter particularly and throw into the frying pan. <br>
Chop the mushrooms and add to the onions. <br>
Once the rice is cooked, drain it off and add it into the frying pan. <br>
Tip the drained sweetcorn into the pan as well and stir it all up. <br>
Break the eggs into the pan (OR beat them together in another bowl and tip into the frying pan) and stir the mixture up. <br>
At this point, you need to keep stirring the mixture, keeping the eggs moving. <br>
Keep going until the eggs have cooked, should take about 5-­‐8 minutes maybe? <br>
