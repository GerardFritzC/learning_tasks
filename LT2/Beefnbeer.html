		<p><b>Ingredients</b> <br>
500g of cheap beef pieces (stewing steak usually is cheap) <br>
500 mls of real ale <br>
4 large onions <br>
2 fat cloves of garlic <br>
tbsp of plain flour <br>
</p>

		<p><b>Method</b> <br> 
Raw beef, roll it in the flour...fry 4-­‐5 pieces at a time in a hot saucepan to <br> 
seal...put to one side when all done, cut the onions into quarters...fry in the same frying pan as the beef...to soak up the juices... <br> 
Towards the end of frying the onion (they should be nicely brown round the edges) throw in the smashed up cloves of garlic. <br> 
Transfer the beef, onions, garlic to a deep casserole dish. Stir in the remaining flour <br> 
pour on the bottle of beer -­‐ really, it isn't going to be wasted!!! <br> 
Cover, and cook at 150 for about 2 and a half hours...will be gorgeous when it <br> 
comes out, trust me...serve with mash <br>
